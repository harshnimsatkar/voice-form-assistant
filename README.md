# 🗣️ AI-Powered Voice Form Filler with Multilingual Support

A full-stack AI assistant that enables users to fill out official government forms by speaking or typing in Hindi, Marathi, or English. The system transcribes, translates, and extracts form data using AI, autofills the appropriate fields, generates a downloadable PDF, and provides step-by-step signing and submission instructions.
